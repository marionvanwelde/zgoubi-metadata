  Store coordinates in file.

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  Store particle coordinates in file FNAME.

  ``FAISCNL`` is an older, less performing, version of ``FAISTORE``, see below for the latter. It produces a lot more
  information on particles at current location, including spin components, decay distance, mass, charge, etc.
  (see list below), and stores it in a dedicated file FNAME (advised name is FNAME = ‘zgoubi.fai’ (formatted write)
  or ‘b zgoubi.fai’ (binary write) if post- processing with zpop should follow). This file may further on be read
  by means of OBJET, option KOBJ= 3, or used for other purposes such as graphics (see Part D of the Guide).
  The data written to that file are formatted and ordered according to the FORTRAN sequence in the subroutine
  impfai.f, where details and possible updates are to found.

  *Case of Binary storage:* it can be obtained from ``FAISCNL`` and ``FAISTORE``. This is for the sake of compactness
  and access speed, for instance in case voluminous amounts of data would have to be manipulated using zpop.
  This is achieved by giving the storage file a name of the form b FNAME or B FNAME (e.g., ‘b zgoubi.fai’).
  The FORTRAN WRITE list is the same as in the FORMATTED case above.
  This is compatible with the READ statements in zpop that will recognize binary storage from that very radical ’b ’
  or ’B ’.

  *Case of FIT[2] procedure :* it may not be desired to store during the FITting process, but instead only when the
  FITtinig is completed. It is sufficient for that to (i) put ’AtFITfinal’ as the first label following FAISTORE
  keyword, this will inhibit all storage until the final run following a FIT procedure, and (ii) avoid using the
  ’nofinal’ instruction in FIT[2] (see p. 156)).
