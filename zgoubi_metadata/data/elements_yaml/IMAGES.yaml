  Particle coordinates and horizontal beam size at distance XL.

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``FOCALE` calculates the dimensions of the beam and its mean transverse position, at a longitudinal distance XL `
  from the position corresponding to the keyword ``FOCALE`.

  ``IMAGE`` computes the location and size of the closest horizontal waist.

  ``IMAGES`` has th same effect as ``IMAGE``, but, in addition, for a non-monochromatic beam it calculates as many
  waists as there are distinct momenta in the beam, provided that the object has been defined with a classification
  of momenta (see OBJET, KOBJ= 1, 2 for instance).

  Optionally, for each of these three procedures, zgoubi can list a trace of the coordinates in the X, Y and in the
  Y , Z planes. The following quantities are calculated for the N particles of the beam (``IMAGE``, ``FOCALE``) or of
  each group of momenta (``IMAGES``)

  • Longitudinal position :

      FOCALE : X = XL

      .. math::

      IMAGE[S] : X = - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i * tgT_i -(\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i * \sum_{i=1}^N tgT_i)/N}{\sum_{i=1}^N tg^2 T_i -(\sum_{i=1}^N tg T_i)^2/N}

      .. math::

      Y = Y_1 + X * tgT_1

  where :math:`Y1` and :math:`T_1` are the coordinates of the first particle of the beam (``IMAGE``, ``FOCALE``) or
  the first particle of each group of momenta (``IMAGES``).

  • Transverse position of the center of mass of the waist (``IMAGE``[S]) or of the beam (``FOCALE``), with respect
  to the reference trajectory

  .. math::

  YM = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i + X tg T_i) - Y = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Y M_i


  • FWHM of the image (``IMAGE``[S])  or of the beam (``FOCALE``), and total width, respectively, W and :math:`W_T`

  $$W = 2.35(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Y M_i^2 - Y M^2)^{1/2}$$
  $$WT = max(YM_i) - min(YM_i)$$
