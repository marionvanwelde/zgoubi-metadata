  Automatic transformation to a new reference frame.

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  ``AUTOREF`` positions the new reference frame following 3 options:

  - If I = 1, ``AUTOREF`` is equivalent to CHANGREF[XCE = 0, YCE = Y (1), ALE = T(1)] so that the new reference
  frame is at the exit of the last element, with particle 1 at the origin with its horizontal angle set to T = 0.
  - If I = 2, it is equivalent to CHANGREF[XW,Y W,T(1)] so that the new reference frame is at the position (X W, Y W )
  of the waist (calculated automatically in the same way as for IMAGE) of the three rays number 1, 4 and 5
  (compatible for instance with OBJET, KOBJ = 5, 6, together with the use of MATRIX) while T(1), the horizontal
  angle of particle number I1, is set to zero.
  - If I = 3, it is equivalent to CHANGREF[XW,Y W,T(I1)] so that the new reference frame is at the position (X W, Y W)
  of the waist (calculated automatically in the same way as for IMAGE) of the three rays number I1, I2 and I3
  specified as data, while T(I1) is set to zero.
  - If I = 4 : new horizontal beam centroid positionning XCE, YCE, ALE is provided. The beam is moved by XCE and then
  centered on YCE, ALE.
  - If I = 4.1 : new beam centroid positionning XCE, YCE, ALE, DCE, TIME is provided. The beam is moved by XCE and
  then centered on YCE, ALE. In addition, the beam is centered on a new relative momentum DCE and new timing value
  TIME.
  - If I = 4.2 : same as 4.1, except that particles all have their timing set to TIME.
  - If I = 5 : new vertical beam centroid positionning ZCE, PLE (position, angle) is provided. The beam is centered on
  vertical position and angle ZCE, PLE.
