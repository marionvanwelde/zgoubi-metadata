  Store coordinates at labeled elements.

  .. rubric:: Zgoubi manual description

  Store coordinates every IP other pass at labeled elements.

  If either FNAME or first LABEL is ’none’ then no storage occurs. Store occurs at all elements if first LABEL is
  ’all’ or ’ALL’.

  ``FAISTORE`` has an effect similar to ``FAISCNL``, with more features.

      - On the first data line, FNAME may be followed by a series of up to 10 LABELs. If there is no label, the print
        occurs by default at the location of ``FAISTORE`` ; if there are labels the print occurs right downstream of
        all optical elements wearing those labels (and no longer at the FAISTORE location).

      - The next data line gives a parameter, IP : printing will occur at pass 1 and then at every IP other pass,
        if using REBELOTE with NPASS ≥ IP − 1.

  *Case of Binary storage:* it can be obtained from ``FAISCNL`` and ``FAISTORE``. This is for the sake of compactness
  and access speed, for instance in case voluminous amounts of data would have to be manipulated using zpop.
  This is achieved by giving the storage file a name of the form b FNAME or B FNAME (e.g., ‘b zgoubi.fai’).
  The FORTRAN WRITE list is the same as in the FORMATTED case above.
  This is compatible with the READ statements in zpop that will recognize binary storage from that very radical ’b ’
  or ’B ’.

  *Case of FIT[2] procedure :* it may not be desired to store during the FITting process, but instead only when the
  FITtinig is completed. It is sufficient for that to (i) put ’AtFITfinal’ as the first label following FAISTORE
  keyword, this will inhibit all storage until the final run following a FIT procedure, and (ii) avoid using the
  ’nofinal’ instruction in FIT[2] (see p. 156)).
